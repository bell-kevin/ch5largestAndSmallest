# ch5largestAndSmallest
Write a program with a sentinel-controlled loop that lets the user enter a series of integers, with a value of -99 signaling the end of the series. After all numbers have been entered, the program should display how many numbers were entered and the largest and smallest of those numbers. For example, if there were 10 numbers entered, with the largest value of 98 and the smallest value of 2, the output would say "Out of these 10 numbers, the largest number is 98 and the smallest number is 2". If the user enters -99 as the first entry, do not print that output.
