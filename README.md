# ch5largestAndSmallest

Write a program with a sentinel-controlled loop that lets the user enter a series of integers, with a value of -99 signaling the end of the series. After all numbers have been entered, the program should display how many numbers were entered and the largest and smallest of those numbers. For example, if there were 10 numbers entered, with the largest value of 98 and the smallest value of 2, the output would say "Out of these 10 numbers, the largest number is 98 and the smallest number is 2". If the user enters -99 as the first entry, do not print that output.

Here is an example with a series of numbers:

Ch 5 Largest Smallest example

Here is an example with no numbers entered:

Ch 5 Largest Smallest quit

Take 2 screenshots of the execution of the program, one with a series of numbers, one with no numbers entered, as shown here.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
